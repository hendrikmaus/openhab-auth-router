# OpenHAB Auth Router

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router)

A quick solution to control sitemap access by authenticated users.

## Use Case

- You run one or more openHAB instances
- The instances are accessed through nginx
- Nginx is used to provide basic authentication
- You want to restrict user access to sitemaps

> Nginx is not a hard-requirement; any other service capable of your desired
> authentication and setting a header called `X-Forwarded-Username` to the authenticated
> username will work fine

## Install

If a working golang setup is available, run:

```sh
# requires golang 1.13+
go get github.com/hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router
```

Otherwise, download the binary for your platform from the [github releases](https://github.com/hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router/releases) and put it into your PATH.

## Usage

> You might like to look at some of the [examples](./examples) to get started as well.

### Config

The router requires a configuration file in YAML format.

The minimal config to run the router as pure passthrough:

```yaml
passthrough: true
```

> This is useful for testing as well.

Using the actual routing features:

- `users`
  - `<name>`
    - `entrypoint`
      Path the user should be routed when trying to access `/`
    - `sitemaps`
      - `default`
        Define the default sitemap to be used.
        This value is used when no sitemap param can be found and
        when a user tries to access a denied sitemap.
        It does not override the basicui service config default.
      - `allowed`
        List of sitemaps with allowed access.
        Special value `"*"` allows access to every sitemap
    - `paths`
      - `<name>`
        This is the path to configure
        - `allowed`
           `true` or `false` define whether the path is accessible or not.
           The value is used in a prefix check. The order of the rules
           matters as the first partial match wins.

Example:

```yaml
passthrough: false
users:
  admin:
    entrypoint: "/start/index"
    sitemaps:
      default: admin
      allowed:
      - "*"
  demo:
    entrypoint: "/basicui/app"
    sitemaps:
      default: demo
      allowed:
      - demo
      - widgetoverview
    paths:
      "/start/index": { allowed: false }
      "/paperui"    : { allowed: false }
      "/doc"        : { allowed: false }
      "/habpanel"   : { allowed: false }
```

This config disables passthrough, so the defined user rules take effect.

The admin user is allowed to access every path, and sitemap. The entrypoint
is set to the default path of an openHAB installation, the dashboard.

The demo user is routed to basicui by default, is only allowed
to access the demo and widgetoverview sitemaps and may not access the dashboard,
paperui, docs or habpanel.

If this user tries to access other sitemaps or restricted paths, the router
redirects to the entrypoint.

### Docker

The recommended way to run the router is using the official Docker image:

> An image for ARM32v6 is also available.

```sh
echo "passthrough: true" > ./config.yaml
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/usr/share/config.yaml" \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router:${TAG} \
    openhab-auth-router \
    -host="0.0.0.0" \
    -port="9090" \
    -target="http://openhab:8080" \
    -config="/usr/share/config.yaml"
```

Now point your browser to port 9090 on the machine the container runs on.
You should be able to access your openHAB as usual.

> If you encounter issues, please open an issue on Github.

### Vanilla Binary

```sh
echo "passthrough: true" > ./config.yaml
openhab-auth-router -host="127.0.0.1" -port="9090" -target="http://openhab:8080" -config="./config.yaml"
```

Now point your browser to port 9090 on the machine the binary runs on.
You should be able to access your openHAB as usual.

> If you encounter issues, please open an issue on Github.

## Setup

In order to ensure that the entirety of your system still functions once
the router is in place, it can be used as pure passthrough proxy. In this
mode it does not provide any restrictions; your setup should work as before.

Start by either pulling the official docker image or downloading the binary
for your platform from [github](https://github.com/hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router/releases).

Depending on your OS, create a service that runs and maintains the router
process.

### Binary Via Systemd

The config file is expected to live at `/usr/share/openhab-auth-router/config.yaml`.

```txt
[Unit]
Description=openhab-auth-router

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/openhab-auth-router \
    -host="0.0.0.0" \
    -port="9090" \
    -target="http://openhab:8080" \
    -config="/usr/share/openhab-auth-router/config.yaml"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Place this `openhab-auth-router.service` file into `/etc/systemd/system`.

Then run `sudo systemctl enable openhab-auth-router.service`.

Finally run `sudo systemctl start openhab-auth-router.service` to start the router running.

To clean up, run:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop openhab-auth-router.service
sudo systemctl disable openhab-auth-router.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/openhab-auth-router.service
```

### Managed by Docker

```sh
echo "passthrough: true" > ./config.yaml
docker run --restart always --name openhab-auth-router \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/usr/share/config.yaml" \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router:${TAG} \
    openhab-auth-router \
    -host="0.0.0.0" \
    -port="9090" \
    -target="http://openhab:8080" \
    -config="/usr/share/config.yaml"
```

### Docker Managed by Systemd

Ensure to replace `${TAG}` with the version you want to run.

The config file is expected to live at `/usr/share/openhab-auth-router/config.yaml`.

```txt
[Unit]
Description=openhab-auth-router
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name=%n \
  -v /usr/share/openhab-auth-router/config.yaml:/usr/share/config.yaml \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  hendrikmaus/openhab-auth-router:${TAG} \
    openhab-auth-router \
    -host="0.0.0.0" \
    -port="9090" \
    -target="http://openhab:8080" \
    -config="/usr/share/config.yaml"
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop -t 2 %n ; /usr/bin/docker rm -f %n

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Place this `openhab-auth-router.service` file into `/etc/systemd/system`.

Then run `sudo systemctl enable openhab-auth-router.service`.

Finally run `sudo systemctl start openhab-auth-router.service` to start the router running.


To clean up, run:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop openhab-auth-router.service
sudo systemctl disable openhab-auth-router.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/openhab-auth-router.service
```

            httpGet:
              path: /readiness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            timeoutSeconds: 5
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /liveness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            timeoutSeconds: 5

```

Asserting the health of the router and connection to the target:

```sh
curl -v host:port/liveness
# should respond with HTTP 200 OK

curl -v host:port/readiness
# should respond with HTTP 200 OK
```

- liveness
  - checks the pure liveness of the process
- readiness
  - determine readiness for traffic
  - determine healthy connection to target system

Now point your nginx to the router instead of the openHAB instance:

```txt
    location / {
        proxy_pass                              http://openhab-auth-router/;
        proxy_redirect                          off;
        proxy_http_version                      1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host                   $http_host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade                $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection             "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP              $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For        $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto      $scheme;

        ## Authentication; leave this out for the first test
        # proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Username   $remote_user;
        # auth_basic                              "Username and Password Required";
        # auth_basic_user_file                    /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }
```

Restart nginx `sudo service nginx reload` and try to access your openHAB instance as usual.

If you run Apache, this configuration was contributed by [sven](https://community.openhab.org/t/authorization-per-sitemap-via-reverse-proxy-and-custom-router/60848/7?u=milford) in the openhab community:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>

	ProxyPassReverse / http://ip_of_your_device:9090/

	<Location />

## Development And Contribution

### Using The Makefile

The Makefile is self-documenting, simply run `make` to see the help.

To build the docker image, run:

```sh
make pkg-docker
```

### Releasing

The router is distributed for many systems, the Makefile provides the means to build
all required packages:

```sh
IMAGE_TAG={version} make pkg-all
```

Now the `./dist` folder is populated and the docker image is built locally.

To push the docker images:

> The docker images can be built individually, run `make` to see the relevant targets.

```sh
IMAGE_TAG={version} make pkg-docker-push
```
